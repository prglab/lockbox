Thrift Dependency
=================

thrift (for serialization and non-blocking server installation)

YOU NEED TO INSTALL libevent DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES BEFORE BUILDING thrift. See
the OS-specific package management sections below.

    # Download from the list provided here:
    # http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/thrift/0.9.0/thrift-0.9.0.tar.gz

    wget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache/thrift/0.9.0/thrift-0.9.0.tar.gz

    # Make sure the non-blocking server option in configured to be built, if you
    # want to run a server.

    ./configure --with-libevent
    make
    make install

    # Verify the nonblocking installation worked.

    pkg-config --libs thrift-nb


Ubuntu
======

    NSS_LIBS=/usr/local/opt/nss/lib NSS_CFLAGS=/usr/local/opt/nss/include \
    ./configure


Running a Server
================

  o If you plan to manage many users' data, then your server will need the
    ability to have many files open concurrently (I'm not doing anything smart
    about this for the time being).

    ulimit -Sn unlimited


Major components

  o Zipping.

  o Remote interface for serialization.

    o thrift

  o Server for serialization.

    o thrift

  o Encryption

    o OpenSSL

  o Delta encoding. Rsync values.

    o courgette

  o Diffing modules.

    o courgette

  o Fork consistency.

    o thrift / hashes from OpenSSL

  o File watching

    o Use python watchdog in order to generate events.

    o Chromium interface may work on Linux...
